											The Botanist has fast become a landmark in the city. <br>
											Based around an old, English country garden – this chain <br>
											of bars is spreading across the country. <br>
											Mother Nature’s very own backyard,high up in the <br>
											Monument Mall, has twinkly-fairy lights, greenery and<br>
											bamboo-style furniture. It’s all of the traits expected <br>
											froma secret-den like garden. The food is reminiscent<br>
											of an English summer, offering fresh salads, rotisserie <br>
											 chicken and even hanging kebabs. <br>

											The restaurants roots date all the way back to 1239 and  <br>
											was once a hostel for King Henry III. It can confidently 	<br>
											lay claim to the title of ‘oldest dining room in the UK’.  <br>
											However, whilst the13th century former medieval friary  <br>
											has a right royal claim to fame, we can’t promise these  <br>
											kinds of guests… But, we can promise traditional British  <br>
											grub served on heavy, wooden banquet tables. The sort  <br>
											you’ve seen on TV. Tuck into seasonal and local produce,<br>
											in the company of a stonewalled hall – housed in the  <br>
											former refectory. This is the North East at its finest.<br>

													 SIX Baltic is the city’s finest glass-fronted restaurant,<br>
													 at the top of the Baltic. This is where you come for  <br>
													 afternoon tea with a side of sweeping views. As the <br>
													 highest point of the art gallery, the interior is  <br>
													 just as minimalist and modern. You’ve got a chrome bar,  <br>
													 glass tables and hardwood floors – as well as   <br>
													 experienced staff. But, it’s not just about the views. <br>
													 The food is locally-sourced and made with the finest   <br>
													 ingredients.Classic British meals get a contemporary  <br>
													 twist at the restaurant,as do the drinks.<br>

										<h3>
										Café 21, winner of Newcastle’s first Michelin star, <br>
										is a simple, yet modern bistro. The emphasis is <br>
										solely on the food – creating simple and imaginative <br>
										dishes. There’s a real love for the sourcing of produce <br>
										and ingredients, evident in the food. It’s classic, <br>
										but crafty, and is, quite frankly, a Masterchef episode <br>
										in Newcastle. This bustling, city centre restaurant – <br>
										close to the beautiful Quayside – is no fuss, and the <br>
										interior reflects this ethos. It’s tasteful, stylish and <br>
										directs attention to the food – just how it should be. <br>
										The comfy surroundings make for a peaceful and <br>
										unforgettable evening meal.<br>

									<h3> 
										The Earl might have had a chequered past, but it’s<br>
										all forgotten now. A once notorious inner city pub, <br>
										linked with Newcastle’s hard men, the Earl of Pitt <br>
										Street is gastro pub personified. It’s taking on a <br>
										hipster lease of life, following a £400,000 revamp,<br>
										with an ‘Alfred Hitchcock meets Vivienne Westwood’ <br>
										interior. In addition, the furniture is deliberately <br>
										mismatched, the requisite exposed brick and cool <br>
										antiques take pride of place. And, depending on where<br>
										you are sat – unusual chicken heads may be peering <br>
										down at you as you tuck into one of the delicious <br>
										(poultry) dishes.<br>
