											These shows will mark the band’s first full British tour <br>
											in almost three years, having last performed across the <br>
											UK in January 2015 when they played 10 sold out  <br>
											shows. Their only UK appearance in 2016 was a one-off <br>
											headlining set at the closing night of the Isle of Wight  <br>
											Festival on Sunday June 12, part of a 15-date European  <br>
											summer festival tour. Isle of Wight festival organizer  <br>
											John Giddings credited the band with “the greatest <br>
											show we have ever had” <br>

												His last tour in 2010, which still officially ranks <br>
												with the Guinness Book of World Records as the  <br>
												biggest selling comedy tour of all time, played to over <br>
												1.2 million people. So why a return to stand-up now?<br>
												Peter says: 'I really miss it. I know how lucky I am <br>
												to be making television series and have really loved <br>
												these past few years working on Car Share but I miss <br>
												doing stand-up. As terrifying as it is, when it works <br>
												there's nothing more fun and exciting. Plus, a lot has <br>
												happened in the last eight years, with Trump, Twitter <br>
												and my Nan getting her front bush trimmed at the age <br>
												of 96. I can't wait to get back up on stage'<br>
